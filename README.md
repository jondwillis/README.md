ðŸ¤— I'm Jon!

I'm a full-stack engineer with more than 10 years of experience who is specialized in iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS.

In college, I wrote an open-source app for Android, [ElectricSleep](https://github.com/jondwillis/ElectricSleep), which got me into mobile development, and I haven't looked back since! I was the first mobile engineer at [Pluto TV](https://www.paramount.com/press/viacom-agrees-to-acquire-pluto-tv), and have worked in startups since my time there.

These days I'm excited about Swift, SwiftUI, TypeScript, and all of the possibilities that advances in AI are enabling.

I'm currently available for consultancy work!

I'm not on social media.
